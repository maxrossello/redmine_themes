# Dwarf Redmine Theme
Public Version 1.0.0

### Inception
Hey folks!

Let's say "hello" to my Redmine theme. I developed this theme to fit large screens - screens over 1600 pixels width. I've used this theme for about two years and it's still in development - it's hard to make it pixel-perfect, so all fixes, PR and improvements welcomed. Overall scripts SCSS and JS not really clear.

### How it works?
1. Dwarf theme built responsive and support HD screens between 1600 and 1920.
2. In HD mode theme navigation transforms to a sidebar.

### Issues List
Below you can see how's list of issues will looks with Dwarf. Almost everything managed with CSS so there's many pseudo-elements which
contain custom icons, blocks and content also.

### Issue Card
I decided to split content inside issue to have two different content areas for input and progression.

### Add a New Issue
I've used Chosen jQuery Plugin for transforming dropdowns to something responsive and useful. Hope it will works on your side.
